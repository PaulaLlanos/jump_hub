In-depth analyses from Story [[Explore JUMP story specified on https://github.com/broadinstitute/2023_12_JUMP_data_only_vignettes/issues/15 
][issue #15]].
* Cluster 1
** Group 1: MYT1-CHRM4-GPR174: Nervous system
- MYT1 is upregulated alongside CHRM4 [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01549-1#Sec25][ref]] 
- Both GPR176 [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4757782/][ref]] and CHRM4 [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01549-1][ref]] are membrane receptors expressed by neurons

*** MYT1
- Also referred to as PKMYT1
- Upregulation promotes cancer resistance
- Inhibits CDK1
- Roles in neuron development
- Part of the three-gene MYT/Neural Zinc Finger (NZF) transcription factor family

*** GPR176
- G-protein coupled receptor
- Governs cyrcadian behavior [[https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10583][ref]] 
- It is expressed in a cyrcadian manner by Suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons

*** CHRM4
- G-protein coupled receptor
- Promotes neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer and castration-resistant prostate cancer.

** Group 2: LZTS2-TSC22D1  
- Both are transcription factors
They are negative correlated in complementary DNA expression data [[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17533171/][ref]].

- Experiment: Mice treated with oxazepam and Wyeth-14643 at 2 weeks and six months
- Measured with RTAQ-PCR showed a reverse pattern.
- Knocking down Tsc-22 did not significantly change the RNA expression of LZTS2. LZTS2 may be upstream of TSC-22.

*** TSC22D1
- Regulates glucose metabolism in homo and heterodimers. [[https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abo5555][ref]] 
- Regulated by (RNA Binding Protein) MEX3D [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41420-022-01049-7][ref]] , which in turn Wnt pathway [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0960740419306176?via%3Dihub][ref]] 
- Inhibits proliferation of colorectal cancer [[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/OTT.S449244][ref]]
*** LZTS2
- Also called Lapser1. And under this name it is also thought to be involved in the B-catenin in the Wnt (still debated) synapsis pathway [[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11064-013-0980-9][ref]]. Potential link to group 1.
- regulates negatively the Wnt pathway.
- Tumor supressor for renal cell carcinoma
- Supresses cell migration and establishes assembyl of central spindle for cytokinesis

** Group 3: LY6K-SLC22A14
Both are differentially expressed proteins in sperm [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10177407/][ref (Suplementary data 1)]]
*** LY6K
- Already known to sperm motility. Acts upstream or within flagelated sperm motility. 
*** SLC22A14
- Not much known, but it is an organic cation transporter.
