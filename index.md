# Getting Started with JUMP

What is the purpose of this website? To provide up-to-date info on everything JUMP-related. We aim to minimize friction for developers, technical writers and biologists to produce and access novel insights and tools. We aim to make this the one-stop shop for the vast majority of JUMP questions, be it computational or biological.

## Choose Your Own Path

[Here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/monorepo/blob/main/libs/jump_rr/README.md#Quick%20data%20access) you can find the up-to-date web tools to explore JUMP from your browser. These are very useful for querying perturbations without needing experience in data analysis or programming. They are also very convenient for a one-off query of the dataset.


### How can I access the How-To guides in a live coding environment?

This table provides direct link to run the guides on your browser. Google Colab is the only supported live-coding web interface.

Alternatively, you can download the notebooks from their respective pages and run them in your local Python environment. We have published a package containing all dependencies, you need only install in your environment using `pip install jump_deps` (Python 3.10 or 3.11).
